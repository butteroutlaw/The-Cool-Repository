# Password Protector

Cybersecurity is a fundamental and increasingly important part of staying safe online in this day and age. Due to the pandemic, companies and institutions around the world are going virtual, which has severely increased the risk for data breaches. With our code, users can safely access a website with the proper credentials. It includes a locking mechanism that prevents brute force attacks to keep our users safe and also features a password reset function where the user answers security questions that they set up previously.

Moreover, our code gets the user’s IP address when creating their account so that when someone tries to log in from an unfamiliar IP address, they must also answer security questions. Our code is also unique because it generates a score for the security of the user’s passwords based on a list of the most common passwords and the complexity of the password.
